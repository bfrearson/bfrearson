## 👋 Hi, I’m Ben

I'm a software developer and the creator of [StreamCam](https://bfrearson.github.io/streamcam/) and [Loopify](https://bfrearson.github.io/loopifyhelp/)[^1].

I care a lot about UX, and so I try to not only make things that solve problems, but solve problems in an ergonomic way. Neither of my apps have a completely unique functionality, but they do try present their interface in a way that the user will hopefully enjoy. 

In the past I've 🔈 designed guitar amplifiers, 👨🏻‍🏫 taught physics, ✍🏻 marked and authored physics exams internationally, ⛪️ pastored a church and 🎧 hosted, produced and edited a [podcast](https://thebcec.org.uk/series/a-b-side-podcast/).

Check out my [website](https://bfrearson.github.io) for more details about me.

[^1]: Loopify is currently in beta, awaiting Spotify to approve wider API access. If you'd like to be added to the TestFlight, please [get in touch](https://bfrearson.github.io/contact)!
